# Password-Generator

Password generator that randomly generates strong passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols for greater account security.

# Site Functionality

When "Generate Password" button is clicked first prompt will ask for length of password. If user enters a number lower than 8 characters or larger than 128 characters an alert will pop up telling them "This length is not in the range of 8-128 characters!!!". If user does not enter is a number indicating the desired length, an alert for pop up informing them "This is not a number!!!".

After the desired length is determined, user will be asked a series of questions asking if they would like upper case letters, lower case letters, symbols, and numbers. Once they have answered those prompts, the javascript code will generate a password.
